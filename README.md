CloudFlareDynamicHelper
=======================

The dynamic helper for CloudFlare.

Usage
-----

Please copy `lib` directory to your binary folder.

> Eg. copy `lib` to `CloudFlareDynamicHelper/Bin/Release` folder.

To simplify this project for C# developers, I haven't ignored `node.js` files such as `node_modules`. That means you needn't to run `npm install`.
